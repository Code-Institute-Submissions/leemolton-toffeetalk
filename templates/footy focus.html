		<h4>By Lee Molton</h4>        
        
		<p>It was FA Cup Quarter-Final Day and over 50 Evertonians gathered in St Luke’s church, but it was not for a mass or to say prayers. The television programme Football Focus was being filmed live ahead of the FA Cup game at Goodison Park. The magic of the FA Cup was in the air and a buzz of anticipation as each Evertonian entered the church. Dan Walker was the presenter and he announced the panel of experts into the room of ex- Chelsea player Graeme Le Saux, ex Aston Villa player Dion Dublin and Everton legend Graeme Sharp.

		<p>The show started with Dan Walker discussing the crisis at Newcastle and their new manager, Rafael Benitez. The 1st question from the floor was about the relegation battle “To all panel members, who do you think will be relegated this season”. Graeme Le Saux answered Aston Villa, Newcastle and Norwich whereas Graeme Sharp thought Sunderland would go down instead of Newcastle. Dion Dublin agreed with Graeme Le Saux. This was a good start to the show. 

		<p>The audience was quiet and listening to the host and panel especially with the next section looking at Everton and Aaron Lennon in particular, Aaron has had a very good couple of months and is enjoying his football. Dan discussed Lennon’s form with Graeme and his goals scored this season. He also read out part of a statement from the new investor at Everton, Farhad Moshiri saying that he is committed to providing funds in the summer and money for a new stadium. Graeme Sharp was then asked which position do you think is a priority to strengthen in the summer? He answered that goalkeeper was a possibility with Tim Howard leaving. Dion Dublin was then asked about the time that Howard Kendall tried to sign him but failed and then left the club. The Evertonians remembered this event well.

		<p>The crowd was then introduced to Speedo Mick who is an Evertonian who wears just his speedos and goggles to all Everton home and away games this season. He got a great big cheer from the crowd, he must be cold in just speedos and he has even agreed  to walk to Wembley if we get through to the semi-final. The highlights of Crystal Palace’s win at Reading was then shown. The vicar from St Luke’s was in the audience and was interviewed by Dan. She discussed the weekly events in the church at every home game and how good the cup of tea tastes. Andy Craven, the Secretary and Treasurer of the Supporters Trust was then asked about the ticket prices for next season. It is going to be a maximum £30 charge for all away games for the next three seasons. A question was then asked “Would other clubs follow Everton’s lead by introducing cheap tickets for young children as we don’t see youngsters at away games anymore?” Graeme Le Saux agreed that this was needed as the young generation need to be encouraged to attend games, Dion also wanted to have cheaper tickets for youngsters. Graeme Sharp said that football is nothing without the fans.

		<p>There was more audience from the crowd, Dan again thanked the Evertonians for applauding, we were really enjoying this show! It is great listening to people talk about football, especially Everton Football Club. The team news was given from the Norwich v Man City game. The panel was then asked about Man City’s chances of winning the League, Dion thought that they were still in the race but Graeme Sharp thought that it was between Leicester and Tottenham. Dan Walker again asked the fans if they thought Leicester would win the League, many agreed that they would. It was good that Dan was constantly talking to the fans and asking for participation throughout. Graeme Le Saux thought it was a massive ask for Man City to still win the League.

		<p>The ex-Everton player Alan Stubbs was then interviewed ahead of Hibernian’s Cup Final appearance. Evertonians still like Stubbs, it was nice to hear of him reaching a Final doing well in his first management job. Dan then visited the Heritage Society which is situated upstairs in St Luke’s. Paul Wharton discussed that it was 125 years this Monday that Everton have won the League Championship at Anfield while they were playing there. This is a good fact and should be commemorated by the Blues.

		<p>The ex-Everton player, Ronnie Goodlass was then interviewed and he discussed the 1977 Semi-final and the heartache of the disallowed goal at Anfield, which cost the Blues a trip to Wembley. In 1966 we won the FA Cup and Ronnie plugged his charity night for Derek Temple coming up in May. 

		<p>The FA Cup replay between Arsenal and Hull was shown and Dan discussed with the panel a possible crisis at Arsenal – is it time for Wenger to go? Graeme Sharp thought that football fans were impatient and that it could possibly be time for him to go. Dan asked the Evertonians would they take successive FA Cups, 3rd places and regular Champions League football. We all cheered and agreed. Of course we would – this would be great, Arsenal fans have been spoilt recently and should enjoy what they have now. Dion said that Arsenal fans should be careful what they wish for. Graeme Le Saux sympathised that Arsenal fans are frustrated that they are not buying the players at the highest level.

		<p>Dan then discussed the problems at Middlesboro with their manager not being at the game tomorrow due to training ground issues. Our Cup opponents, Chelsea were discussed next with the 2009 FA Cup Final being shown when Chelsea beat us, Dan apologised to the Everton fans and there were a few boos. We try to forget this day! Dion was asked about the problems at Chelsea this season. He thought that there would be changes in the summer.

		<p>The Cup Quarter-Final between West Ham and Man United was discussed and Angelo Agbonna summed up West Ham’s good season so far in an interview. Graeme Le Saux said “what a great job Bilic has done this season.” 

		<p>The final question was asked about the development of Chinese football and will there be an impact on the Premier League. Dion thought that money will play a big part in making players go to China, Graeme Le Saux said that China don’t have the fans though and pointed towards the Everton fans. Graeme will do anything to get a cheer!

		<p>The show ended with Dan thanking the Evertonians and the guests, there were big cheers from Evertonians. We had enjoyed our time taking part in the live show of Football Focus and all walked out discussing what a great show it had been. The buzz in the crowd was great now and everyone was starting to look forward to the Cup Quarter-final clash. The Evertonians left the church and went to prepare for the FA Cup later on in the day. Football Focus and the BBC are welcome at Goodison and St Luke’s any time.
